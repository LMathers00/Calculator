# Calculator
Making a functioning calculator using javascript, HTML and css
This calculator accepts multiple inputs and returns an answer with all four of the basic operators functioning correctly
If i were to go further on this i would begin to add features similar to a scientific calculator such as square root to sine and cosine etc

The +/- button works but only as a single parameter equation so presing '9' '+/-' '=' in that order would return '-9'
