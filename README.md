# Calculator
Making a functioning calculator using javascript, HTML and css
This calculator accepts multiple inputs and returns an answer with all four of the basic operators functioning correctly

The javascript is very heavily commented to explain what each of the sections of code does
The scss is sorted nicely into sub files stored away in a folder

If i were to go further on this i would begin to add features similar to a scientific calculator such as square root to sine and cosine etc

The +/- button works but only as a single parameter equation so presing '9' '+/-' '=' in that order would return '-9'
